# Overview

This is a simple ray tracer program, based off of **Ray Tracing in One Weekend**. The referenced material uses **C++** to program the ray tracer, whereas this project is written in **C**.

# Project Setup

TODO - tree file structure

To compile the program on Linux or MacOS, from the project directory, run

    % ./build.sh

Once the program is compiled, execute it with

    % ./run.sh

This will open the rendered image after, which will also be stored as `results/render.ppm`.

For more documentation, see the header files under `include/`. TODO - add more documentation.
